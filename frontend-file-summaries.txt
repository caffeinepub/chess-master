  "frontend/src/types/chess.ts": "TypeScript type definitions for the chess game; restores the `Board`, `Piece`, `Square`, and `Player` type aliases needed by existing utilities, while also adding `GameMode` with 'online', `GameResult`, `DrawReason`, and the updated `GameState` interface with `selectedPiece`, `gameOver`, and `drawReason` fields.",
  "frontend/src/utils/chess-setup.ts": "Utility to create the standard 8x8 chess starting board with all 32 Unicode pieces, plus helper functions to identify piece colors.",
  "frontend/src/utils/move-validation.ts": "Complete move validation logic for all chess pieces including the exact isValidKnightMove L-shape logic, plus check detection and board mutation helpers.",
  "frontend/src/utils/valid-moves.ts": "Move computation utilities; adds a new `getValidMoves(board, position, player)` function as a Position-based alias for `getValidMovesForPiece`, while keeping all existing exports intact.",
  "frontend/src/utils/game-status.ts": "Game status detection (checkmate/stalemate/check/draw); fixed to import `hasAnyValidMoves` from `valid-moves` (not the removed inline version) and `DrawReason` from types, with optional `drawReason` parameter support.",
  "frontend/src/components/ChessSquare.tsx": "Extended with `isLastMove` prop that renders a `.last-move-highlight` overlay div on the source and destination squares of the most recent move, visually distinct from selection and check highlights.",
  "frontend/src/components/ChessBoard.tsx": "Chess board renderer; updated to accept both `selectedPiece` and `selectedPosition` prop names, both `gameOver` (GameResult) and `isGameOver` (boolean) props, and resolves the game-over message from either source for backward compatibility.",

  "frontend/src/pages/ChessGame.tsx": "Main chess game page with fixed AI move triggers for both one-player and auto-play modes. Uses `useRef` to store latest `gameState`, `gameMode`, and `isAIThinkingRef` so that `setTimeout` callbacks always read fresh state instead of stale closures; the one-player AI effect no longer includes `isAIThinking` in its dependency array (preventing cleanup from cancelling the pending timer), and the auto-play loop uses a self-scheduling `cancelled` flag pattern that survives React re-renders without being interrupted.",

  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global chess styles extended with `.last-move-highlight` CSS class (warm amber tint overlay), `.thinking-dot` animated bouncing dot classes with staggered delays, and `@keyframes dotBounce` / `@keyframes pulse-glow` animations for the AI thinking indicator.",
