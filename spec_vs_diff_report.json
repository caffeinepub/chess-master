  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/index.html to reference a new favicon path (/assets/chess khelo online.png), which addresses part of REQ-1 (the favicon/logo asset path in index.html). However, there is no evidence in the diff of any React component being updated to render the correct logo image in the UI. The frontend-file-summaries.txt does not mention any logo component changes, and no logo asset file is added. The fix appears partial — only the HTML favicon reference is updated.",
