  "summary": "The diff implements a substantial rebuild of the Chess Khelo Online application. Most requirements from REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be addressed. REQ-2 (dismissible mobile banner) is fully implemented in MobileAppNotice.tsx. REQ-1 core UI components (board, squares, game mode selector, results panel, status, leaderboard, player stats, profile setup, online setup, login, background music, move sound) are all present. However, the diff is noted as truncated with 13 modified files omitted, meaning the main game logic (ChessGame page, AI minimax, chess engine/types, backend Motoko actor) cannot be verified from the provided diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "AI opponent uses minimax with alpha-beta pruning and makes legal moves",
      "reason": "No AI logic or chess engine file is visible in the diff. The ChessGame page and any AI implementation files are among the 13 omitted modified files, so this cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "Chess clocks count down per player during timed games",
      "reason": "GameStatus.tsx renders clock display but no clock countdown logic (timer hook or interval) is visible in the diff. The actual countdown implementation would likely be in ChessGame or a dedicated hook, which are in omitted files.",

      "requirement": "All backend logic must remain in a single Motoko actor in backend/main.mo",
      "reason": "The diff contains no changes to backend/main.mo and the file is not listed among modified files. It is unclear if the backend was updated to support all required features.",

      "requirement": "Online multiplayer allows creating and joining games via shareable game IDs with full game play",
